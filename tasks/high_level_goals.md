### Goals recap
You want to evolve a simple expression language into a small but ergonomic scripting language with:
- Expressions: add ternary operator, list and dict literals, indexing, assignment.
- Statements and control flow: conditionals and loops (while, C-style for, foreach).
- Function definitions and calls.
- A refactor of name lookup and “object” traversal to enable dot/member access, index access, and callables to coexist cleanly.
- A practical architecture and rollout plan with clear semantics.

Below is a concrete design that scales, is implementable in small steps, and fits nicely with your existing parser approach (chumsky).

---

### High-level architecture
- Lexing/parsing: keep chumsky; add a statement layer with blocks and declarations above your expression grammar.
- AST: split into Expr, LValue, Stmt, Block, and Program. This isolates assignment targets and control flow.
- Runtime types: a Value enum for primitives and composites, and a Function type representing user-defined and native built-ins.
- Environments: an Environment stack (Vec of scopes) for lexical scoping and a separate Value traversal system for member/index access.
- Interpreter: evaluate statements and expressions with short-circuiting and a small set of control signals (Break, Continue, Return).

---

### Core runtime model

#### Value
- Int(i64), Float(f64), Bool, Str(String)
- List(Vec<Value>)
- Dict(Map<String, Value>) — Map can be BTreeMap (deterministic order) or IndexMap (preserve insertion order).
- Func(Function) — user-defined or native function.
- Unit — for statements without a value (or use Option<Value> with None as Unit).

Optional future: Null/None, ranges, iterators.

#### Function
- User { params: Vec<String>, body: Block, maybe captures } — start without closures.
- Native(fn(&[Value]) -> Result<Value>) + metadata (name, arity, doc).

#### Environment and lookup
- Environment: Vec<Scope>, Scope = HashMap<String, Value>.
- Name lookup: search from innermost scope outward.
- Path/member traversal: resolve base identifier to a Value, then traverse:
    - Member: obj.field — Dict => get field; else error (optionally add method maps later).
    - Index: obj[idx] — List: idx is int within bounds; Dict: idx is string.
- LValues support write targets: Var(name), Member(obj, field), Index(obj, idx).

This matches your desire to look up “objects” independently and then traverse.

---

### Grammar and AST

#### Expression precedence (low to high)
- Assignment: target = expr (right associative). Optionally add compound ops later.
- Ternary: cond ? then : else
- Or: a || b
- And: a && b
- Equality: ==, !=
- Comparison: <, <=, >, >=
- Add/sub: +, -
- Mul/div/mod: *, /, %
- Pow: ^ (right-assoc)
- Unary: !, - (negation)
- Postfix chain: call, index, member (left-assoc): expr(args), expr[expr], expr.field
- Primary: literals, identifiers, parenthesized

#### New literals
- List: [expr, expr, …] with optional trailing comma.
- Dict: { key: expr, key2: expr, … } where key is ident or string literal to start.

#### AST shapes
- Expr
    - Literal(Int/Float/Bool/Str)
    - Var(String)
    - Member { object: Box<Expr>, field: String }
    - Index { object: Box<Expr>, index: Box<Expr> }
    - Call { callee: Box<Expr>, args: Vec<Expr> }
    - Unary { op: UnaryOp, expr: Box<Expr> }
    - Binary { op: BinaryOp, left: Box<Expr>, right: Box<Expr> }
    - Ternary { cond: Box<Expr>, then_br: Box<Expr>, else_br: Box<Expr> }
    - ListLit(Vec<Expr>)
    - DictLit(Vec<(DictKey, Expr)>) where DictKey = KeyIdent(String) | KeyStr(String)
    - Assign { target: LValue, value: Box<Expr> }  // if you want assignment as an expression

- LValue
    - Var(String)
    - Member { object: Box<Expr>, field: String }
    - Index { object: Box<Expr>, index: Box<Expr> }

- Stmt
    - Let { name: String, init: Option<Expr> }  // recommend explicit declarations
    - ExprStmt(Expr)
    - If { cond: Expr, then_block: Block, else_block: Option<Block> }
    - While { cond: Expr, body: Block }
    - ForC { init: Option<Box<Stmt>>, cond: Option<Expr>, post: Option<Box<Stmt>>, body: Block }
    - ForIn { var: String, iterable: Expr, body: Block }  // start with simple var pattern
    - Break, Continue
    - Return(Option<Expr>)
    - FnDef { name: String, params: Vec<String>, body: Block }

- Block(Vec<Stmt>)
- Program(Vec<Stmt>)

You can also keep assignment as a statement-only feature initially if you prefer.

---

### Parsing plan with chumsky

- Spacing/comments: you already have whitespace and line comments; keep a shared spacer parser.
- Postfix chain: switch to a primary parser and then repeatedly apply postfix operators in a loop: call(args), index([expr]), member(.ident). This subsumes your dotted path and call handling and enables chains like a.b(c)[0].d.
- Literals: add list and dict literal parsers with proper delimiters and separators.
- Ternary: parse after the logical-or level: expr '?' expr ':' expr. Ensure correct precedence and right associativity of assignment.
- Assignment: define an lvalue parser (Var/Member/Index shapes). Parse “lvalue = expr” at the lowest precedence. If you want assignment only as a statement, parse it within statement parser and require a semicolon.
- Statements and blocks:
    - Block: { stmt* } with semicolons, allowing optional semicolon after block-like statements.
    - If/else, While: classic forms with parentheses around condition.
    - ForC: for (init?; cond?; post?) block — init/post can be Let or ExprStmt; you can desugar to While during evaluation.
    - ForIn: for ident in expr block — iterate list values and dict keys (or pairs if you prefer).
    - FnDef: fn name(params) block; initially disallow captures to avoid closures.
    - Return/break/continue as keywords.

Use spans from chumsky to improve error messages; reserve type/runtime errors for the evaluator.

---

### Evaluation semantics

- Booleans and short-circuit: &&, ||, and ternary must short-circuit. Consider requiring Bool for conditions (simple and clear), at least initially.
- Numeric ops: Int with Int -> Int; mixed -> Float; division returns Float (recommended). Pow handles floats.
- Equality: structural for lists/dicts; type-sensitive.
- Indexing:
    - List: idx must be non-negative int within bounds; else error.
    - Dict: key must be string; else error. Missing key -> error (or consider a safe_get built-in).
- Assignment and scope:
    - Recommend explicit declarations: let x = ... creates a new binding in current scope.
    - Plain assignment updates the nearest existing binding; error if not previously declared.
    - Member/Index assignments mutate in place.
- Control flow:
    - While: evaluate cond each iteration; break/continue via control signals.
    - ForC: desugar to init; while (cond) { body; post; } or implement directly.
    - ForIn: iterate lists (values) and dicts (keys). Optionally add entries() to iterate (key, value).
- Functions:
    - No closures initially: reject references to outer locals.
    - New scope per call; positional params; arity must match.
    - First-class functions are allowed so you can assign/call via variables or members.
    - Return unwinds to nearest function; return outside function is an error.

### Refactoring name/object lookup

Replace “lookup by full dotted path” with a two-phase approach:
1) Resolve base identifier in env to a Value.
2) Traverse postfix chain:
    - Member: if Value::Dict => get field; else if method protocol available => resolve; else error.
    - Index: list/dict access.
    - Call: if Value::Func => invoke; else error.

This enables seamless a.b(c)[0].d = x with LValue support for the left-hand side of assignments.

---

### Minimal built-ins and method protocol (optional but useful)

- Globals: print, len, type, keys, values, items.
- List methods: push, pop, insert, remove.
- Dict methods: get, set, has, remove.
- Provide method dispatch via a per-type method map that returns Func values so obj.method(args) desugars to method(obj, args) if desired.

---

### Testing strategy

- Parsing tests (AST snapshots) and evaluation tests:
    - Literals, arithmetic, precedence, strings with escapes.
    - List/dict literals and nesting.
    - Indexing and member access/assignment.
    - Ternary.
    - If/else and while (with counters to verify break/continue).
    - ForC and ForIn.
    - Function definition/call, recursion, return semantics, shadowing.
    - Errors: undefined variable, type errors, index out of bounds, missing key, wrong arity, assigning to non-lvalue.

Add fuzz-like random expression generators later.

---

### Incremental rollout plan (PR-sized steps)

1) Postfix chain refactor
- Introduce Expr::{Var, Member, Index, Call}; replace ad-hoc path/call parser with postfix loop.

2) Lists and dicts
- Add ListLit/DictLit, Value::List/Dict, and read-only indexing/member access.

3) Ternary
- Parse and evaluate with correct precedence and short-circuiting.

4) Assignment + LValue
- Add LValue validation and implement variable updates and list/dict mutations.
- Add Let declarations (recommended) and choose declaration rules.

5) Statement layer
- Add Block, ExprStmt, If/Else, While, Break/Continue.

6) Loops
- Add ForC (desugar to While) and ForIn (lists → values, dicts → keys by default).

7) Functions
- FnDef and Func values; implement call semantics and Return.
- Forbid closures initially; revisit later.

8) Built-ins/methods
- Small stdlib and opt-in method protocol for List/Dict.

9) Polish
- Better errors with spans, pretty-print AST, and performance tweaks.

---

### Concrete syntax examples

- Literals and collections
    - [1, 2, 3]
    - {a: 1, "b": 2}
- Postfix chains
    - user.name
    - arr[0]
    - dict["key"]
    - obj.method(1, 2).other[3]
- Ternary
    - is_prod ? 443 : 8080
- Assignment
    - let x = 1 + 2;
    - x = x + 1;
    - user.name = "Alice";
    - arr[0] = 42;
- If/while
    - if (n > 0) { sum = sum + n; n = n - 1; } else { sum = 0; }
    - while (i < len(arr)) { i = i + 1; }
- For loops
    - for (let i = 0; i < 10; i = i + 1) { sum = sum + i; }
    - for k in dict { print(k); }
    - for v in list { print(v); }
- Functions
    - fn fact(n) { if (n <= 1) { return 1; } return n * fact(n - 1); }
    - let r = fact(5);

---

### Key defaults and trade-offs (recommended)

- Declarations: require let for new bindings; assignment updates existing.
- Conditions: require Bool strictly.
- Dict keys: start with strings/idents only.
- Division: Int/Int -> Float.
- Blocks: keep statement-only for now (no implicit last-expression value).
- Errors: out-of-bounds/missing-key is an error; provide safe helpers later.
- Method style: start with free functions (push(list, x)); add dot-method sugar later.

---

### Clarifying questions

1) Declarations: Do you want explicit let for new variables, or allow implicit creation on first assignment?
   Answer: No "let", just implicit creation on first use
2) Truthiness: Should conditions require Bool strictly, or allow truthy/falsy across types?
   Answer: Allow any type to be truthy/falsy (i.e. 0 is falsy, "false" is falsy, [1, 2] is truthy, {a: 1} is truthy)
3) Dict keys: Limit to strings/idents for now, or allow any expression as key?
   Answer: Keys can only be strings
4) Blocks: Should blocks be expression-valued (return last expression) or statement-only?
   Answer: Blocks should be statement-only
5) Foreach over dict: iterate keys, values, or key-value pairs? If pairs, do you want tuple/list destructuring?
   Answer: Iterate key-value pairs (i.e. `for (k, v) in dict { ... }`)
6) Method style: Should list/dict methods be accessible via dot (list.push(1)) from the start, or keep only free functions first?
   Answer: Everything should be accessible via ".", because they are dict traversals
7) Assignment as expression: Should x = y yield the assigned value (expression) or be statement-only?
   Answer: Statement-only
8) Numeric behavior: Int/Int division to Float, or keep integer division and add a separate op for float division?
   Answer: Int/Int division to Float
9) Semicolons: Always required inside blocks, or permit newline termination?
   Answer: Permit newline termination
10) Functions: OK to forbid closures initially? Are nested functions allowed? Are functions first-class (assignable to variables)?
    Answer: Forbid closures initially; allow functions to be assigned to variables (and that's the only way to do nested functions)
11) Dict ordering: Do you need insertion order preserved?
    Answer: No, ordering does not matter
12) Error policy: On missing dict key or out-of-bounds index, error or return a Null/Unit value?
    Answer: Friendly error returned
